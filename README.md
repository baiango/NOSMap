# ✨ NOSmap - Dinitrogen oxide Hashmap
NOSMap is a virtual homework experimental AVX2 accelerated Hashmap ​project that aims to have a 90% load factor while being fast for low-latency number crunching and memory-intensive data processing algorithms at disregard of quadratic implementation difficulty and portability. However, multiple mini unit tests are made to ensure correctness of NOSMap.

NOSMap was designed for to end the search for a faster Hashmap on x86 CPU for a long time.
